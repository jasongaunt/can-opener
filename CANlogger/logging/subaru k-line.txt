; for both CAN-based and older Subarus

; how to scale the results using a RPN (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) notation, with data and operators seperated by commas
; the operators are as following:
;       + : add
;       - : subtract
;       * : multiply
;       / : divide
;
;       x : represents the raw (unscaled) parameter
; 123.456 : example of a constant
;
; if no scaling is specified, the raw value will be used
;
; the OP2 has no FPU - it must do floating point calculations in software which can 
; create performance issues, so be efficient in your RPN expressions by doing the following:
;
; * minimize the number of operations; e.g. ((x * 2) + 1) * 2 => x * 4 + 2
; * don't divide by a constant when you can multiply instead; e.g. x / 4 => x * 0.25
; * don't make constant expressions that can instead be pre-calculated; e.g. x * 3 / 4 => x * 0.75

; Notice that the next 3 parameters have a "sampgroup = 1" setting.
; There are 15 sample groups (1 - 15) that you can assign parameters to. 
; Any parameters assigned to a sample group will be alternately logged in a single
; timeslot at a lower speed, the speed being 1 / N that of the sampling interval -
; where N is the number of parameters in the sample group. In this example, these
; 3 parameters will be logged at 1/3 the speed, but will also use 1/3 of the communications
; to the ECU, allowing you to log everything else faster.
; Since you can make up multiple sample groups, you can fine tune how fast different kinds of
; parameters are logged.

;-------------triggers---------------
;
; note that parameters must be previously defined 
; before defining triggers using them
;
; triggers allow you to control when logging starts and stops
; this example sets up triggers such that logging only occurs
; when the engine is running (RPM > 0)
;
; triggers consist of a condition (a RPN expression using comparison operators)
; and an action. the RPN comparison operators match those in the C language:
;
; > < >= <= == != && ||
;
; if the condition evaluates to a non-zero value, that action is taken
;
; at present the following actions are available:
;
; start - starts logging to a file (if not already doing so)
; stop - stops logging to a file
; newfile - starts a new file (only if already logging to a file)
;
; IMPORTANT - if you have no triggers defined, logging will start automatically.
; if you have *any* triggers defined, logging will not start until a start action
; occurs

action = start

conditionrpn = RPM,0,==
action = stop

; here is a second triggering example using the rear defogger switch
; uncomment it and comment out the sample above to use it

;conditionrpn = defogger_sw,1,==
;action = start

;conditionrpn = defogger_sw,0,==
;action = stop


; here is an example of using both previous values in a trigger and using
; the newfile action.
; this example starts a new logging file (logging must have already been started)
; whenever the throttle increases from below 95% to above 95%
; #throttle refers to the previous throttle sample

; be careful with the conditions under which you create newfiles, or you may accidentally
; create thousands of files!

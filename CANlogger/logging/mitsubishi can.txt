; sample logging configuration file for openport 2.0
; must be named logcfg.txt and be placed in the root directory of the
; microSD card inserted in the openport in order to work

; this sample logs using the KWP2000 ReadMemoryAddress command over the ISO15765, which works
; for CAN based mitsubishis that have had their ROMs modified to allow the use of this command.
; this command is also known as "mode23" on some forums. since this command reads directly from 
; ECU memory, the paramid addresses used are different for different ROM versions. the following 
; example is for the USDM EVO X ROMs in the 526800xx series.

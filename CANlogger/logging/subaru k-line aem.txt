; sample logging configuration file for openport 2.0
; must be named logcfg.txt and be placed in the root directory of the
; microSD card inserted in the openport in order to work

; this sample logs using the SSM protocol over the K-line, which works
; for both CAN-based and older Subarus

; this particular example is simplified to show the use of Subaru K-line logging
; along with the serial output of the AEM UEGO gauge unit (which is RS-232)
; the gauge can be connected by wiring the gauge RS-232 TX and ground signals to the 
; ring and sleeve terminals of a 3/32" stereo plug which can then be plugged into
; the OP2.

; the "ascii" channel type can listen on any protocol for incoming numeric text
; the default protocolid is 9, which corresponds to the 3/32" jack receive-only serial port
; the default baud rate and setting are 9600,N,8,1. all of these can be changed for other scenarios

; the ascii channel considers anything other than the characters {'0'-'9','+','-','.','E','e'} to be a 
; delimiter between different numbers. furthermore, the carriage return and line feed characters are 
; considered to mark the beginning of a new row of data. you can sample data from a particular column of
; numbers by choosing a paramid starting at 1 which indicates the column number

; in the case of the AEM UEGO, there is simply one column of data, and it is already scaled appropriately
